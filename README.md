# Zaufany Kierowca - Backend üöó

> **Note:** This repository does not contain the full code for the Zaufany Kierowca app. Some parts of the implementation have been omitted for privacy reasons.

This repository contains the backend for the **Zaufany Kierowca** mobile application. The backend provides authentication, ride-sharing, reservation, and notification functionalities. It communicates with the frontend and handles all server-side logic, ensuring smooth interaction between users and the app's features.

## üì± Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Includes registration, login, logout, email verification, password reset, and session management.
- **Ride Management**: Allows users to create, update, search, and delete rides, including details like origin, destination, date, and number of passengers.
- **Reservation System**: Users can search for rides, make reservations, and cancel them. Notifications are sent via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for any ride changes.
- **Review System**: Users can leave opinions (reviews) after completing a ride.
- **Notification System**: Push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to alert users of ride-related updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server.
- **Express**: Web framework to structure the API.
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the backend for type safety.
- **TypeORM**: Object-Relational Mapping tool for PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing user and ride-related data.
- **Zod**: Schema validation library to validate API inputs.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Sends push notifications to users.
- **Nodemailer**: Sends emails for user verification and password recovery.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and other in-memory operations.
